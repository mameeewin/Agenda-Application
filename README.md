## What is an Agenda?
  `An agenda is what you use to plan stuff. It can also mean something like thinking. Here is an example, “I have my own agenda” means I have my own plan. Like a plan to clean the dishes. 2nd Example, “If I have my agenda, but my friend has his own agenda”, It means my friend thinks differently from me. `

## Inspiration
  `Our inspiration to create this app is that in our class, me and my friends must write agenda in our agenda book every Monday, and we wanted to make it easier, so that the user can save it on to the computer. `

## Objective
  `Make writing agendas easier.` 
  `Allow others to work using the agenda.`
  `Allow others to be able to print their agenda from the app.`

## Information That We Needed To use
  `How to create the Agenda. `
  `How to code Python. `
  `How to code Python Tkinter GUI. `
  `How to code FPDF2 to create a PDF.`

## Work Process
  `Brainstorm -> Designing the Program -> Code a prototype -> Code the program with my teammates -> Create a slideshow for presentation -> Present`

# How To Use The Application
  `1.When you click the app, the start screen pops up. You can read the facts in the screen. To start the app, you can click the start button!`

  `2. When you start the app, the editor runs, This is the first part, the date, and the name. The title shows up too!`

  `3.After that, we will now create the plan. As you see, we have 4 entry boxes to write our plan, and you can check it out anytime. When you are done just click submit. `

  `4. You will see a box that says “0/155”, that is the letter counter. If you go over the limit (That is 155) it will warn you with red text, then it will cut the letters that are over the limit when you export into a pdf, or preview the pdf.`

  `5. After you click the submit button, new “entry” boxes will open which you can record what happened, and fixes for next time.`

  `6.On the bottom of the app, there are buttons that you can access. Most buttons do what their name says, like “Preview PDF” previews the pdf, and “Save”, saves the agenda. `
